# Event Aggregator

(work in progress)

### Event Aggregator feature of Prism
An easy way to communicate between modules in a loose coupled way is to use the event aggregator of Prism, which is basically publish and subscribe.

### Communicate with web services and update  the UI using Event Aggregator 

With the Event Aggregator in place for the status module, the application communicates with the web api of Acrowire and retrieves the timesheet data for a given Email using the Request button of the toolbar. More information about Event Aggregation can be found [here](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/blob/master/Documentation/WPF/70-CommunicatingBetweenLooselyCoupledComponents.md#event-aggregation).
