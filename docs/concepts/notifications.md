# Notifications

### Use new features of Prism 6.0 for validation
Some features changed from Prism 5.0 to 6.0 and one very useful is the **ObservesProperty**.

### Implement Notifications to the user using the Notification infrastructure of Prism
In order to show messages, interaction with the user with yes/no modals or to implement a custom view to show notifications, we use the Interactivity.InteractionRequest namespace of Prism.
