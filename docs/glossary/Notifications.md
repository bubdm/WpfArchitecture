# Notifications 

Provides change notifications to any data-bound controls 
in the view when the underlying property value changes. 
This is required to implement the MVVM pattern and 
is implemented using the [BindableBase](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.practices.prism.mvvm.bindablebase(v=pandp.50).aspx) class.
