### Region

A named location that you can use to define 
where a view will appear. 

Modules can locate and add content to a region 
in the layout without exact knowledge of 
how and where the region is visually displayed. 

This allows the appearance and layout to 
change without affecting the modules that 
add the content to the layout.
